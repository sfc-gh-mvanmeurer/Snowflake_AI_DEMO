# Snowflake Intelligence Demo

This project demonstrates the comprehensive Snowflake Intelligence capabilities including:
- **Cortex Analyst** (Text-to-SQL via semantic views)
- **Cortex Search** (Vector search for unstructured documents)  
- **Snowflake Intelligence Agent** (Multi-tool AI agent with orchestration)
- **Git Integration** (Automated data loading from GitHub repository)


## Setup Instructions

**Single Script Setup**: The entire demo environment is created with one script:

1. **Run the complete setup script**:
   ```sql
   -- Execute in Snowflake worksheet
   /sql_scripts/demo_setup.sql
   ```

2. **What the script creates**:
   - `SF_Intelligence_Demo` role and permissions
   - `Snow_Intelligence_demo_wh` warehouse
   - `SF_AI_DEMO.DEMO_SCHEMA` database and schema
   - Git repository integration
   - All dimension and fact tables with data
   - 4 semantic views for Cortex Analyst
   - 4 Cortex Search services for documents
   - Web scraping function with external access integration
   - 1 Snowflake Intelligence Agent with multi-tool capabilities

3. **Post-Setup Verification(Optional)**:
   - Run `SHOW TABLES;` to verify 20 tables created (17 original + 3 Salesforce CRM)
   - Run `SHOW SEMANTIC VIEWS;` to verify 4 semantic views
   - Run `SHOW CORTEX SEARCH SERVICES;` to verify 4 search services
   - Run `SHOW FUNCTIONS LIKE 'WEB_SCRAPE';` to verify web scraping function
4. **RUN DEMO**:
   - Use AI/ML option on the left navigation bar
   - Pick "Snowflake Intelligence"
   - Make sure to pick the right agent at the bottom-left

### Data Flow Explanation:
1. **Source Repository**: GitHub repository contains both CSV files (20 demo data files) and unstructured documents (PDF)
2. **Git Integration**: Git API Integration (SF_AI_DEMO_REPO) automatically syncs all files from GitHub to Snowflake's internal stage
3. **Structured Data**: CSV files populate 13 dimension tables and 4 fact tables in a star schema
4. **Salesforce CRM Data**: 3 additional Salesforce tables (sf_accounts, sf_opportunities, sf_contacts) provide complete customer journey tracking
5. **Unstructured Data**: PDF documents are parsed and stored in the `parsed_content` table
6. **Semantic Layer**: Business-specific semantic views provide natural language query capabilities over structured data
7. **Marketing Revenue Attribution**: Enhanced Marketing Semantic View connects campaign data to Salesforce CRM for end-to-end ROI analysis
8. **Cortex Analyst Layer**: Each semantic view connects to a dedicated Text2SQL service for natural language to SQL conversion
9. **Search Services**: Domain-specific Cortex Search services enable vector search over unstructured documents
10. **Web Scraping Service**: Custom Python function enables real-time analysis of external web content
11. **AI Orchestration**: The Snowflake Intelligence Agent orchestrates between Text2SQL services, Search services, and Web Scraping
12. **User Access**: Users interact through API connections to the agent using natural language queries
